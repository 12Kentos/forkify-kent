# Forkify

## Overview

Forkify is the first big project I built using plain html/scss/javascript. It's an app that allows you to search for recipes gathered from around the web. Once you find a recipe you like, you can then add it to your bookmarks which are saved using local storage. You can also adjust the amount of servings you would like and the instructions will adjust accordingly. Additionaly you have the capability of adding in your own recipes.
